# Library-of-DataStructures-and-Algorithms
A github repository that is meant to be a community project where people will implement and explain those implementations using code. This is meant to serve as a referencing manual for the study of Data Structures and Algorithms. This is an idea that is open to interpretation and change and can evolve in the direction the community deems best.
